        <p class="text">
            Biking is more than just a way to get from one place to another—it’s an adventure that blends freedom, fitness, and exploration. Whether cruising through city streets, racing down rugged mountain trails, or pedaling along scenic countryside paths, biking offers a sense of connection with the world around you.

            <h2 class="desc" > PARAGLIDING </h2> 

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the thrill of soaring through the open sky with nothing but a wing above and endless horizons around you. It’s a sport that combines adventure and serenity—offering an adrenaline rush as you launch from towering cliffs or hills, and a deep sense of calm as you glide effortlessly with the wind. Each flight brings a bird’s-eye view of landscapes that feel both vast and intimate, making paragliding not just about flying, but about embracing freedom and perspective in its purest form.

            <h2 class="desc" > SURFING </h2> 

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Surfing is the art of riding the waves, a perfect mix of balance, power, and flow with the ocean. Each ride is unique—the wave’s energy carrying you forward while you dance along its crest. It’s both thrilling and meditative, demanding focus in the moment yet offering a deep connection to nature. For surfers, the ocean becomes a playground and a teacher, where every wave is a chance to challenge limits, find freedom, and experience the pure joy of moving with the sea.
